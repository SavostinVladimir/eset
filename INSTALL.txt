ESET INSTALLATION
===================

Here is a short summary of the installation process (which can take just a few
minutes):

1. Move the Eset files into your web directory.

2. Create a single database for Eset to store all its tables in (or choose an
   existing database).

3. Visit your Eset site with a browser. You should be taken to the
   install.php script, which will lead you through creating a config.php file
   and then setting up Eset, creating an admin account etc.

4. Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php every minute.

Good luck and have fun!
