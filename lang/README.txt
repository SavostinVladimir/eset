Eset Language Packs

This directory contains the standard packaged Eset language files,
for making the Eset interface appear in different interfaces.

The default language for Eset is the English language, under the
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

To add more languages to Eset, you can either:

 1) use the Eset languages GUI in the interface to fetch
    new languages and install them in your 'dataroot' directory.

 2) download them and unzip the packs in this directory manually
