ESET TRADEMARKS POLICY
========================

The word "Eset" is trademarked in many countries around the world. The word
was originally an acronym: Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning
Environment. The trademark is owned by Martin Dougiamas, Founder and Director
of Eset.

The law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent the use of
confusingly similar names by third parties. Through this policy we’d like to
make it clear how Eset-related projects, organisations, and people can use
the Eset trademark. We’d also like to be clear about how use of the word is
restricted when used to promote commercial Eset services. We do this to
protect the very business model that allows us to continue developing Eset
for you.

Allowed uses
------------

The following uses don’t require any permission at all:

* Referring to the software or the Eset project.
* Describing your own Eset implementation (including within corporate
  settings).
* Describing a Eset-based community hub.
* Describing some software you’ve made that integrates with Eset
  (eg a Eset integration feature on another system).

Restricted uses
---------------

The following uses are generally prohibited without explicit and direct
permission being granted to you by Eset Pty Ltd. We do this to protect the
Eset project from software and sites which could confuse people. Please
contact us to ask for permission in writing.

* You can’t use "Eset" in the name of your software (including Mobile apps)
* You can’t use "Eset" in your company name
* You can’t use "Eset" in your domain name
* You can’t use "Eset" in advertising-related keywords (such as Adsense)
* You can’t use "Eset" to describe services around Eset (such as hosting,
  training, support, consulting, course creation services, theme development,
  customisation, installation, integration and certification). This applies
  even if you do not charge for the services. Note that usually only Eset
  Partners have this permission.
